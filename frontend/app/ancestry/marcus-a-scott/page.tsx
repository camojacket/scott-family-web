                                        Marcus A. Scott was born February 2, 1890, in Tarboro, South Carolina, to Marcus
                                        and Caroline Scott. He received his education in the public schools of Tarboro.
                                        He married Maggie Williams, also a native of South Carolina. In 1910, he and his
                                        family moved to Long County, Georgia. Being active in civic and Christian
                                        affairs, he joined Macedonia Baptist Church in 1919 under the leadership of Rev.
                                        S. B. Stewart. Here he was elected church clerk in 1934. He was ordained as a
                                        deacon and served as superintendent of the Sunday School from 1940-1949, at
                                        which time he moved to Florida. He became an ordained minister at Mt. Sinai
                                        Baptist Church in Gifford, FL. After returning to Long County, Georgia, he
                                        served as assistant pastor of Mt. Zion Baptist Church for a number of years and
                                        as a Bible teacher in the Ludowici District Union of the Tattnall Missionary
                                        Baptist Association until he became incapacitated. He was a farmer and owned his
                                        own farm. After the death of Maggie Scott, Marcus married Lena Rountree in May
                                        of 1929. Marcus and Lena held many family reunions and started a tradition that
                                        we have carried on to this day.
