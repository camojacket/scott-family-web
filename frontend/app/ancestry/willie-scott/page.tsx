                                        Willie “Bill” Scott was born in 1905 in Tarboro, South Carolina. He grew up in
                                        Ludowici, Georgia in an area known as the Broadlevel. As a young man, he owned a
                                        store on the Broadlevel. He later moved to Florida during a working season with
                                        his wife, Mae, and decided to make his home there. He opened another store there
                                        where he sold general items, including kerosene for heating. His home was right
                                        behind the store. His only daughter, Dora, recalls that Bill owned a pet raccoon
                                        that was very large and never left the yard. Other Scott family members moved to
                                        Vero Beach, Florida, following Uncle Bill including James, Grace and for a short
                                        time, Marcus “M.D.” Phillips. This area was more attractive because it offered
                                        more opportunities, more work, and higher pay. Many people migrated there for
                                        seasonal work, such as tomato, fruit, and bean picking.
