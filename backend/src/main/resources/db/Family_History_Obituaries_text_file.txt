 Antionette Walker (Scott)

On February 28, 1931, Antionette was born to the Late Jack and Roberta Cook-Hudson. Although she used the name “Antionette” most of her life, she later learned that this was not her given name at birth. After many years of not needing a birth certificate to live in this society, a time arose (age 62) that required her to produce one. Antionette wrote to the Department of Vital Statistics to request a copy of her birth certificate and to her dismay, it revealed her true birth name as Susie Hudson. Since she had used the name of Antionette all of her life, she decided to keep it; therefore, she legally changed her name to Antionette.
On July 21, 1948 Antionette united in Holy Matrimony with the late Reverend James Scott. From this union she bared nine children, five boys and four girls.
Antionette received her basic education in the Indian River County School District.
Antionette possessed a quiet spirit, but worked very diligent to meet the needs of her family and others and did so with love and adoration, without complaining. She cared for each of her twenty-four grandchildren and a great number of her great-grandchildren until her declining health prevented her from doing so. Antionette’s life truly depicts the essence of the virtuous woman spoken of in Proverbs 31.
Antionette attended the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ (House of Refuge) under the pastorship of Elder George M. Dix, where she accepted Jesus Christ as her personal Savior and was baptized in Jesus name. At church she was known to everyone as Mother Scott.
She is preceded in death by Reverend James Scott, her daughters Linda P. Scott and Shirley Scott-Dean.

A Time to Live:
Linda received her primary education in the Indian River County School District; thereafter, she earned a Bachelor of Science Degree from the University of South Florida in 1978. Upon graduation from college, she gladly accepted a position as an elementary school teacher with the St. Lucie County School District and later the Indian River County School District. Upon her demise, Linda was employed at Hope Academy located at the Gifford Youth Activity Center. As an educator, she was destined to mold and shape the minds of each of her pupils to prepare them to reach their highest potential. She devoted amazing energy towards developing practical lessons that would ensure each student’s success. In addition to emphasizing the value of a primary education, she unequivocally stressed the importance of gaining in-depth knowledge and understanding of the unadulterated word of God. Linda will be especially remembered for her dynamic performance in reciting various poems she learned many years ago.
A Time to Serve:
Linda gave her life to the Lord in December 1980 in Augusta, GA. Since that time, her ultimate desire has been to please the Lord. She took advantage of every opportunity to witness God’s word to others, whether it was with an audible voice, a letter, a note placed in your door or a heart stirring religious tract. She had no respect of persons when sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. She practiced the principles of “pure” religion as instructed in the bible; she visited the fatherless and the widows in their affliction. Her various ministries included mentoring and tutoring youth, making scheduled visitations to those who needed spiritual inspiration and guidance and volunteering her services wherever needed. She established “The Girls Night Out” fellowship to provide an outlet for women to relax, socialize and share testimonies or words of encouragement. Linda put her heart into everything she endeavored to accomplish.
A Time to Die:
Though Linda departed this life on May 14, 2002, she will forever be remembered by those whose lives she intimately touched.
